I have defined Routes for Signup Login and Logout in this project and I have used local mongodb.

## Local mongodb connection URL 
    "mongodb://localhost:27017/appiness"

## Signup API Route
    http://localhost:3000/users/signup

## Login API Route
    http://localhost:3000/users/login

## Logout API Route
    http://localhost:3000/users/logout

I have used express generator to create a basic templete for my project. In this project we have "models" folder, where I have defined the user Schema. Inside "route" folder we have "users.js" route for all the request.
